# Project Explanation
This repository contains codes and dataset of our college subject's final project. It aims to predict wether someone is vulnerable to diabetes based on some attributes.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project are from kaggle with the title **"Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset"** that can be acquired from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?select=diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv">link</a>.

Our dataset is a combination of two (2) datasets, which are:
- "diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015". This dataset has 21 feature variables and is balanced.
- "diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015". This dataset has 21 feature variables and is unbalanced.

The combination of these 2 datasets resulted in a single dataset with **229474 observations** and **22 features**

# Our Method
We are trying some machine learning models to predict wether someone have the possibility of having diabetes, such as **Random Forest Classifier**, **SVM**, and **Deep Learning**.
